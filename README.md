# SeaPy: An open-source python package for calculating and predicting mechanical properties and instabilities of solids with unknown microstructures, using spatially resolved sequences of strain images but no constitutive equations.
## https://stefanospapanikolaou.faculty.wvu.edu/research
SeaPy is a python package for performing three main tasks that are labeled as "Stability of Elasticity Analysis"(SEA):
1. Use a sequence of spatially resolved strain images to construct an elastic "fingerprint" of incipient elastic instabilities.
2. Populate the library libΨ with "fingerprint" and mechanical properties of "training" data.
3. Use image recognition to compare fingerprints and identify corresponding probabilities for reconstructing unknown microstructures.
The package includes all the necessary tools for performing SEA on a set of images. Tutorials are provided with model microstructures, libraries and plausible predictions.
